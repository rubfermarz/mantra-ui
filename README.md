# 🕉️ MantraUi WIP 🚧

A component library for Angular17+. The main idea is to provide a set of
components that can be used in any Angular project. The components are designed
to be simple, easy to use, and customizable. The project comes with a base app as a
catalog of the components and apart the library itself. In the future, the library will be
published to npm.
